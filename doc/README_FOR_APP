creation example :
rails generate scaffold Entrant name:string email:string phone:string number:string vehicle_class_id:integer vehicle_make:string vehicle_model:string vehicle_color:string event_id:integer

only min_time_diff is used currently...I think that's all that's necessary...

Design

 event_id
 min_time_diff - min difference between two times on 1 station.  times closer than this are ignored.
 break_time - this # of seconds after a time moves the 'current' station speed to the next slot (not a dup)
